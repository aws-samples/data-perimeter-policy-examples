## Description
The following table contains service-owned resources that AWS services use to perform actions on your behalf:
* The *Resource type* column contains the resource type of a service-owned resource. 
* The *Resource owner* column contains the name of a service that uses the service-owned resource to support its operations.
* The *Resource ARN* column contains the ARN format of the service-owned resource.
* The *Description* column contains information about the feature that require access to service-owned resources specified in the *Resource ARN* column. If your users and applications are using the described feature, policies listed in the *Policy example* column must allow access to the service-owned resources.
* The *Policy example* column contains links to policy examples that allow access to service-owned resources specified in the *Resource ARN* column. <br /> * VPC endpoint policies must allow access only when you access AWS services through AWS PrivateLink.
